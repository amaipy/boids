# boids
Scripts for Boids implementation on Unity (2020.2.0b6.3259)

## Implementation

The collision detection of the boids uses shaders for a faster calculation. 

Keyboard button 1 is the view from the top of the tower, directed towards the middle of the group. 

Keyboard button 2 is the view behind the group. 

Keyboard button 3 is the side view of the group. 

Keyboard button 4 is the top view of the group. 

The boid color is randomly selected from 6 options. 

Space button pauses the movement of the boids, but you can still add and remove. 

Button + adds a random boid.

Button - remove a random boid.

Esc button exits the application. 

F button enables or disables Fog (only available in the editor, not final executable). 

M button increases maximum speed of target boid. 

N button decreases the maximum speed of the target boid.
